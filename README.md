# TODO APP

I my second ever webdev project using React,
with as little help from the tutorials I was using as possible. Referring to it only to fill in the caps of my knowledge.

Overall I think I was pretty successful.

I even went above and beyond, and managed to save and load from local storage. This aspect was not included in the tutorial I was following and was done purely throught reading the 'UseEffect' documentation. 

I did this as I felt that a ToDo App is useless if your list of tasks were not being saved and it seemed like a challenge that was still doable but above my current knowledge of webdev.
